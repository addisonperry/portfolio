        <p>
          Addison Perry is an architecture student and designer interested in
          objects, spatial systems, and the social life of buildings.
        </p>

        <p>
          His work explores how architecture can operate as a cultural container,
          foregrounding community narratives, material presence, and everyday use.
        </p>

        <p>
          He is currently completing his undergraduate architecture degree at
          Cal Poly Pomona and works with Modern for All, focusing on furniture,
          archives, and restoration.
