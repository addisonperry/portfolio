          Addison Perry is an architect and designer based in Los Angeles. He received his Bachelor of Architecture degree from California State Polytechnic University, Pomona. His early academic work has been featured in publications such as Archinect and presented to internationally recognized Japanese architect Toyo Ito.

          His work examines architecture as a cultural container. It operates as a framework through which narratives, material presence, and everyday use are made legible. Rather than treating buildings as static objects, his projects foreground lived experience, collective memory, and the social conditions embedded within form.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          He has contributed to projects with ZGF Architects in Oregon, DAGLI in Luxembourg, and design studios in Los Angeles.
